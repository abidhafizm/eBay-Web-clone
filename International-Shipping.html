  <div class="faq-title">FAQs</div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">What is eBay International Shipping?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">eBay International Shipping is a new shipping service that removes the hassle associated with international shipping. eBay handles tracking, customs clearance, and returns. You will generally see lower shipping costs* and be able to track the status of your order from your eBay account.

*Compared to the non-negotiated cost of shipping with many other international carriers; eBay has negotiated competitive shipping costs for eBay International Shipping. Total international shipping cost is subject to change and depends on the destination country, weight, and dimensions of an item.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Who pays duties and taxes?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">Items purchased from abroad might be subject to import duties and taxes that a buyer has to pay. Application of duties and taxes and the amount depends on the destination country, item price and item weight.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">What kind of items can I buy using eBay International Shipping?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">At the moment, eBay International Shipping is available on most items up to $2,500 item value (excluding taxes, duties, and delivery fees) and located in the US.

However, items included in eBay’s hazardous, restricted or regulated materials policy, and items that don’t follow our International trading policy are not available with eBay International Shipping. View a list of restricted or prohibited categories.

Note: This is not an exhaustive list and it may be updated based on transportation regulations and export laws, and on macro environment or international regulations.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">How are eBay International Shipping and the Global Shipping Program different?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">eBay International Shipping keeps all of the benefits of the Global Shipping Program while offering lower shipping costs and much simpler buyer experience with eBay handling all aspects of international returns and any other claims. eBay International Shipping has replaced the Global Shipping Program in the US, but you may see it available on other non-US listings.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">How do I track my orders and why do I see two tracking numbers?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">You can follow your package online all the way to your shipping address when we upload tracking information. You will see 2 tracking numbers because the item will be shipped via two shipments. First, it will be shipped from the seller to the U.S. domestic shipping hub (first tracking number). Upon receiving the item, eBay will manage the shipment directly to your shipping address (second tracking number).</div>
  </div>

If multiple shipping options are offered, you can see the shipping details and compare price and estimated delivery dates for each option available. In this case, you’ll be able to choose the shipping method at the checkout.</div>
  </div>
